Matt's Teaching Site
====================
Matt revolutionizes the use of tech in the classroom.

Templates
---------
Just copy template.php and replace the title and content comments with what you want.

Course Supplemental HTML
------------------------
You can add supplemental HTML content to course pages.  Just author the content in a php file (you don't need the template for this, or <html> or <head> or whatever.  Just the specific snippets you want), put it in the class/ directory, and in the courses database table put the path to that php file (courses/physics1.php, for example).

Your Old Stuff
--------------
Your old stuff is in the ``bak`` dir.  Lemme know if you need help migrating the content from there to the new format.
